## About

**Framework of Red Oxidized Snakes** - The Discord application framework with a Rusty head, Ruby heart and Pythonic appendages. Made to have perfect stability and concurrency with an easy to write module system.

## The Idea

Each wrapper for Discord has it's own advantages and disadvantages, and usually includes a framework of it's own to help build the application that you need, fully in the language it's built for. However a problem starts to arise from the simple nature of programming languages in their core. The simpler the language to humanly understand, the heavier it is for the machine, increasing it's faults. And the reverse being the case for languages that are efficient and safe, they are tough to work with and understand. So we're making a compromise. Make the core in Rust, and make the modules in much simpler interpreted languages, Ruby and Python.
